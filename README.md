stereo varispeed looper / delay / timeline-smoosher

quick start:

- plug a stereo signal or two mono signals into the inputs on norns.
- head over to the params page.
- nb: when the buffer is completely cleared (at startup and after KEY 3 + KEY 1 are held), cranes will record incoming audio at 1x speed and will immediately play back at the rates specified in the params page.
for the most immediate fun, I suggest setting speed voice 1 to 0.5 and speed voice 2 to -1.
- head back to the performance interface.
- tap KEY 2 to record into the buffers. also, make some sounds!
- to loop, tap KEY 2 again. this sets the loop points (s1/e1 and s2/e2) to the length of the recording. you should hear your material played at half-speed on the left and reversed on the right. you should see the one / two counters counting in the same direction and at the same speed as your audio.
- hold KEY 1 until you see s1 and e1 change to s2 and e2. this switches which buffer you want to control with the buttons and encoders.
- use ENC 2 and ENC 3 to adjust the start and end points of the selected buffer’s loop, with 1/10th second resolution. you should see the counter for the buffer lock to the new start and end points.
- tap KEY 2 to toggle overdub / overwrite for the selected buffer. you will see some friendly birds flying alongside your loop when overdub / overwrite is engaged.
- nb: to retain continuous audio, overdub / overwrite write to the selected buffer at the rate specified in the params page.
- adjust ENC 1 to crawl the spectrum of overdub / overwrite. over: 0 is full overdub, adding incoming audio to the pre-existing audio in the selected buffer. over: 1 is full overwrite, replacing pre-existing audio in the selected buffer with incoming audio.
- fun thing to try: adjust start and end points past the existing audio and write into a new section of the selected buffer, then slowly re-introduce the prior section.
- tap KEY 3 to perform a speed bump on voice 1. hold KEY 3 to produce a more dramatic change. KEY 3’s influence is selectable in the params, under KEY3. ~~ is a small pitch deviation, 0.5 is half-speed, etc.
- hold KEY3 + KEY 1 to completely erase all buffers. if you hit KEY 2 again after this, you’ll get back to the paper crane.
